# Project Documentation

## Step 1: Script Generation
Used ChatGPT with a structured prompt system to generate hooks, scripts, and CTAs.
Focused on emotional triggers and relatability.

## Step 2: Video Creation
- Video created in Gemini
- Vertical 9:16 format
- Stock gym footage used
- Animated captions added
- Motivational background music included
- Total duration: ~25 seconds

## Step 3: Optimization Strategy
- Strong hook in first 3 seconds
- Fast-paced editing
- Clear CTA at end
- Designed for Instagram Reels engagement

## Strategic Insight
The advertisement focuses on solving the emotional pain point (lack of consistency) rather than selling gym features.
This improves relatability and conversion likelihood.

## Outcome
A fully structured AI-powered UGC ad campaign simulation ready for deployment.
